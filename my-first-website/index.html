                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                Sylvan woke up in the forest, not remembering anything. She saw plants that seemed familiar and decided to explore. She collected forest stuff like flowers and berries, and put them back where they belonged. As she did this, she started remembering bits and pieces. She found out she could make different footprints and turn green in the sun. Even her ears could change color, but she had forgotten about these abilities when she woke up. Later, she found a letter and discovering that she and her family were once part of the elfin community that lived in the forest, now endangered due to deforestation. She was the only one left. By returning everything to the forest, she remembered who she was and got her powers back. Now, she's going to rebuild her home here.
