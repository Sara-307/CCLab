                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Sylvan lives in an ancient forest with rich biodiversity. However, the forest has been devastated. Sylvan and her family lost their habitat and she hopes to regain her memories and rebuild her home.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Initially, Sylvan appears as a small, translucent being. As she chooses to return items to the forest, she regains her memory. She realized that her body can undergo a transformation, gradually turning green in the sunshine. In her final form, she resembles a vibrant and energetic elf, with pointed ears and ethereal green hues.</p>

                Sylvan is a survivor of the elf species, which once thrived in the forest it woke up in. The elf species faced extinction due to forest destruction, and the creature lost its memory during this time. Sylvan is motivated by a deep connection to its forest habitat and a desire to restore the natural balance that was disrupted by the destruction of the elf species' home.
